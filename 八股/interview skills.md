# Interview Skills

## Self Introduction

Remember to tell the interviewer what you can bring to the bussiness. You can show your skills and experience which will help the company.
You can say 3 's':
First: Success. Such as 'I have been doing some work for many years and have achieved some good results.'
Second: Strength. Such as 'I have a good work ethic and can work under pressure.'
Third: Situation. Such as 'What I am looking for is a company that I could add value to and help me grow with the company.'

**Self-Introduction:**

Good afternoon everyone. I'm from Shanghai University, majored in computer science and technology. 

I focus on backend development and practical experience in technology risk management, particularly through my recent internship with the Agricultural Bank of China. 

There, I developed a departmental activity management module to streamline approval workflows, making processes more automated and standardized. 

I also participated in an Innovation Training Program where I developed the backend of the web application for an auxiliary medical treatment platform, which can improve diagnosis accuracy.

I bring a strong work ethic, adaptability, and team spirit. I can handle high-stress environments. I am committed to efficient, user-oriented work. 

My ability to analyze systems and implement improvements under pressure has helped a lot in my previous roles.

I am looking for an opportunity where I can bring my technical strengths in backend and risk management, contribute to your team with new insights, and grow alongside the company. 

My goal is to add value by helping enhance the security and efficiency of your technology processes, aligning with EYâ€™s mission of sustainable value creation.
