# Interview Skills

## Self Introduction

Remember to tell the interviewer what you can bring to the bussiness. You can show your skills and experience which will help the company.
You can say 3 's':
First: Success. Such as 'I have been doing some work for many years and have achieved some good results.'
Second: Strength. Such as 'I have a good work ethic and can work under pressure.'
Third: Situation. Such as 'What I am looking for is a company that I could add value to and help me grow with the company.'
